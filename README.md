## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, My name is Nataly Aranda!
 
### About Me
I am a physicist with a masterâ€™s degree and a Ph.D. in geophysics.
During the last year of my doctoral degree, I started working as a professor at a university, teaching physics 
and doing research in geoscience for three years. As a professor and researcher, 
I discovered my passion for working with data, analyzing trends, and managing vast amounts of data. 
I felt that the part that I most enjoyed working as a professor was when I worked with data in my research.
For that reason, I decided to pursue the post-graduation course in Analytics for Business Decision Making. 
In this course, I learned how to apply my research skills to another area as the business area. In addition, 
during this period, I learned and perfected my data analyst skills.
Now I feel prepared to start working as a data analyst.
