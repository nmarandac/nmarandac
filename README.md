## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, My name is Nataly Aranda!
 
### About Me
I am a physicist with a masterâ€™s degree and a Ph.D. in geophysics. During the last year of my doctoral degree,
I started working as a professor at Ikiam University. I taught Physics and did research in geoscience for more than three years. 
As a professor and a researcher, I discovered my passion for working with data by analyzing trends and managing vast amounts of data.
The part that I most enjoyed working as a professor was when I was working with data in my research. For that reason, 
I decided to pursue the post-graduation course in Analytics for Business Decision Making at Mohawk College. In this course, 
I learned how to apply my research skills to another area as the business area. In addition, during this period, 
I learned and perfected my data skills. Now I am prepared to start working as a Data Analyst.
